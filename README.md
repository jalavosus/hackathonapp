Your temple has a Misheberach list. 

Let's be real, it's older than your grandma.

We're in the 21st century. This just isn't how we do things anymore. 

Welcome to MyMisheberach. 

You, internet denizen, have instant access to a giant database full of people who need your prayers. 
Not only can you see a random list of people to daven for, but you can sign up. And get text messages sent straight to your phone, and emails straight to your email.

# Developer stuff
We like pretty code.

So, we used Jade, and Coffeescript. And meteor.js, because apparently that's the new big thing. 

As a result, not only is our code beautiful, but it probably works better than HTML and JS.

We've also deployed to Heroku, because we like jumping on bandwagons. Visit mymisheberach.herokuapp.com.

We used semantic-ui as our CSS framework, because Bootstrap is just as old and crusty as your temple's misheberach list.
